# 🔐 Password Strength Checker
 
This is a simple Python script that checks the strength of a password based on the following criteria:  
- **Length** (minimum 8 characters)  
- **Numbers** (at least one)  
- **Uppercase letters** (at least one)  
- **Lowercase letters** (at least one)  
- **Special characters** (@, $, !, %, *, ?, &)  

If a password meets all the criteria, it is classified as **strong**. Otherwise, the script provides feedback on how to improve it.
